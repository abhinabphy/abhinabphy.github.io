I’m Abhinab Das, a DeFi engineer working at the intersection of protocol design, on-chain execution, and incentive mechanisms.

Most of my work comes from building real systems rather than theoretical designs. I’ve shipped multiple Web3 projects across EVM and Move-based ecosystems, each focused on a specific protocol or market problem.

Some of the things I’ve built:

CryptoMilan — a proof-of-attendance protocol for Web3 events, combining on-chain verification with real-world constraints like geofencing and identity, built during CoinDCX Unfold.

Suiza — a privacy-preserving fitness protocol on Sui that uses zero-knowledge proofs for selective health data disclosure, with on-chain commitments and off-chain storage.

ChainTune — a decentralized music platform on Aptos with NFT-based releases, automated royalty distribution, and staking mechanisms tied to listen-count dynamics.

CritiQ — a blockchain-based review system integrating on-chain storage, cross-chain reward distribution, and AI-based authenticity checks.

Across these projects, I’ve worked on:

Smart contract design for reward distribution and staking logic

Execution-aware systems that account for MEV, ordering, and adversarial behavior

Cross-chain and multi-ecosystem deployments (Aptos, Sui, Avalanche, EVM)

Alongside building, I work as a Web3 security researcher, where I analyze smart contracts and protocol behavior using static analysis, fuzzing, and runtime monitoring. This security background influences how I design systems — especially around edge cases, economic exploits, and failure modes.

My work has been recognized through multiple hackathon wins, including CoinDCX Unfold, Aptos Winter School, and Hack4Bengal, which I treat less as trophies and more as validation of shipped, working systems.

This site is a collection of my projects, technical notes, and protocol explorations, mostly focused on DeFi infrastructure and market-driven smart contracts.
